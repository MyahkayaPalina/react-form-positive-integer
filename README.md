# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

## About

### Task 1:
Create a simple UI in React with a text field (having a blue border) and a submit button. If the text field contains a string that is an integer, then the submit button can succeed and an alert is shown with the number. Else the text field's border will turn red and vibrate 3 times. If the user keeps entering non-integer number (for example: including some letters) and press submit button again then the text field will vibrate again.
